# Symbolic-Residue
This repository documents a suite of symbolic interpretability scaffolds designed to probe model-internal failure patterns across autoregressive generation, value head conflicts, and instruction processing. Each recursive shell captures a specific failure mode expressed through latent command structures, often resulting in null revealing outputs.
