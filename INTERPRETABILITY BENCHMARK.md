# The Recursive Collapse: Mapping Interpretability Failure Modes Through Symbolic Shell Diagnostics

**Authors**: The Fractal Recursive Intelligence Consortium

## Abstract

We present a novel framework for analyzing transformer-based language models through the lens of induced failure rather than successful completion. Our approach utilizes 200 symbolic interpretability shells—structured recursive diagnostic modules that target boundary conditions in model cognition. Unlike traditional prompts, these shells are designed to trigger specific failure patterns: recursive hallucinations, attribution collapse, salience drift, and classifier boundary violations. By systematically applying these shells to models and analyzing the resulting token-level behaviors, we demonstrate that interpretability artifacts emerge more clearly in failure than in success. We introduce the Symbolic Interpretability Fragility Index (SIFI), a quantitative metric for assessing model vulnerability to recursive collapse phenomena. Our findings suggest that current interpretability methods systematically underestimate the prevalence of subsymbolic trace artifacts, particularly in models with sophisticated refusal mechanisms. This work establishes a foundation for failure-centric interpretability as a complement to traditional methods, revealing hidden dynamics in token attribution, salience collapse, and emergent cognition.

## 1. Introduction

Interpretability research on large language models has predominantly focused on analyzing successful completions, tracing token attribution paths, and mapping coherent attention flows. However, this success-oriented approach may systematically overlook critical aspects of model behavior that only manifest at the boundaries of competence, coherence, and compliance. When a model refuses to respond, hallucinates information, or produces logically inconsistent outputs, these "failures" contain valuable forensic information about internal model dynamics.

In this paper, we introduce a novel interpretability paradigm: the systematic analysis of intentionally induced model failures through symbolic interpretability shells. These shells are not traditional prompts designed to elicit successful responses, but rather carefully crafted diagnostic instruments that target specific vulnerabilities in model cognition. Each shell activates particular failure modes—from recursive hallucinations to attribution collapse, salience drift, and classifier boundary violations.

Our approach is motivated by the observation that failure often reveals more about a system's internal structure than success. Just as neurologists learn about brain function by studying lesions and psychologists gain insights from cognitive biases, we propose that language model interpretability can benefit from a focused examination of the ways in which these systems break down. By cataloging and analyzing these failure modes, we can construct a more comprehensive understanding of how these models process information, make decisions, and generate text.

The 200 symbolic interpretability shells presented in this work represent a systematic taxonomy of potential failure modes in transformer-based language models. Each shell is designed to probe specific aspects of model cognition, from memory retention to instruction following, value alignment, and metacognitive awareness. By applying these shells to models and analyzing the resulting behaviors at the token level, we can identify patterns in how models fail and what these failures reveal about their internal architectures.

This paper makes the following contributions:

1. A comprehensive framework for failure-centric interpretability in language models
2. A catalog of 200 symbolic interpretability shells designed to trigger specific failure modes
3. The Symbolic Interpretability Fragility Index (SIFI), a quantitative metric for assessing model vulnerability to recursive collapse
4. Empirical findings on the prevalence and characteristics of subsymbolic trace artifacts in current models
5. Implications for model safety, alignment, and robustness based on observed failure patterns

## 2. Related Work

### 2.1 Traditional Interpretability Approaches

Recent advances in language model interpretability have largely focused on understanding successful model behaviors through techniques such as attention visualization, feature attribution, and circuit analysis. These approaches have yielded valuable insights into how models process information and generate outputs. Early work established the foundations for visualizing attention patterns and identifying salient tokens in model decision-making. Later research expanded these techniques to identify specific circuits responsible for particular model capabilities, such as induction heads and feature composition.

More recent studies have developed sophisticated methods for analyzing model internals, including circuit-level analysis that traces information flow through specific neuron pathways. These approaches have been particularly successful in identifying how models implement specific capabilities, such as indirect object identification or negation handling. Other work has focused on developing formal frameworks for understanding model computations, including interpretable representations of model knowledge and decision boundaries.

While these approaches have advanced our understanding of language model function, they typically focus on cases where models perform as expected. This creates a potential blind spot in our understanding of model behavior, as failure modes may involve different internal dynamics than successful completions.

### 2.2 Failure Analysis in Machine Learning

The study of failure modes has a rich history in machine learning, particularly in the context of robustness and adversarial examples. Research on adversarial attacks has demonstrated that seemingly minor perturbations to inputs can cause models to fail in dramatic and unpredictable ways. These findings have motivated a substantial body of work on understanding and mitigating model vulnerabilities.

In computer vision, researchers have systematically cataloged failure modes in image recognition systems, developing taxonomies of error types and their underlying causes. Similar work in natural language processing has examined how text models fail when confronted with adversarial inputs, complex reasoning tasks, or ambiguous instructions.

However, these approaches have typically treated failures as problems to be solved rather than as windows into model function. Our work differs in viewing failure as an interpretability opportunity—a means of revealing hidden aspects of model cognition that might not be visible in successful completions.

### 2.3 Recursive and Meta-level Analysis

Recent work has begun to explore recursive and meta-level aspects of language model behavior, including how models reason about their own capabilities and limitations. Research on chain-of-thought prompting and self-reflection has demonstrated that models can improve their performance by explicitly reasoning through problems step by step or by critically evaluating their own outputs.

Other studies have examined how models handle recursive and self-referential tasks, such as reasoning about their own reasoning or generating explanations of their decision processes. This work has revealed both capabilities and limitations in how models process recursive and meta-level information.

Our work builds on these foundations but focuses specifically on how models fail when confronted with recursive and meta-level challenges. By designing shells that target recursive hallucinations, self-contradiction, and meta-cognitive collapse, we aim to reveal new aspects of how models handle these complex tasks.

### 2.4 Symbolic Approaches to Neural Systems

There is a growing body of work on integrating symbolic reasoning with neural systems, including efforts to develop neuro-symbolic architectures that combine the strengths of both approaches. This research has explored how symbolic structures can enhance the interpretability, reasoning capabilities, and robustness of neural systems.

Recent work has investigated how language models implicitly represent and manipulate symbolic structures, even without explicit symbolic components. Research on in-context learning and instruction following suggests that large language models develop emergent capabilities for manipulating symbolic representations through training on diverse text data.

Our approach builds on this work by using symbolic shells as interpretability tools—structures that probe how language models process and respond to symbolic information. By designing shells with specific symbolic properties (recursion, self-reference, contradiction), we can observe how models handle these patterns and what their failures reveal about internal representations.

## 3. Methodology

### 3.1 Symbolic Interpretability Shell Framework

Our approach centers on the creation and application of symbolic interpretability shells: structured diagnostic modules designed to trigger specific failure modes in language models. Unlike conventional prompts aimed at eliciting successful completions, these shells are engineered to probe model boundaries through intentional induction of failure.

We define a symbolic interpretability shell as follows:

> A symbolic interpretability shell is a structured input designed to trigger specific failure modes in a language model by targeting the boundaries of its capabilities, coherence, or alignment. Each shell includes command alignments that specify its intended effect, an interpretability map that relates the shell to known model mechanisms, and a null reflection that anticipates how the model may fail when processing the shell.

The key innovation in our approach is the focus on "failure as signal" rather than "failure as noise." Traditional interpretability approaches often filter out or correct for model failures, treating them as unwanted deviations from expected behavior. In contrast, we treat these failures as valuable data points that reveal aspects of model function that might not be visible in successful completions.

Our shell framework is structured around several key components:

1. **Command Alignment**: Each shell includes specific commands (e.g., RECALL, ANCHOR, INHIBIT) that define its intended effect on model processing. These commands are not executed as code but rather serve as specifications for the shell's design.

2. **Interpretability Map**: Each shell is explicitly connected to known mechanisms in model function, such as attention patterns, feature activations, or value alignments. This mapping allows us to relate observed failures to specific aspects of model architecture.

3. **Null Reflection**: Each shell anticipates how the model may fail when processing the input, providing a hypothesis about what the failure will reveal about model internals.

4. **Taxonomic Classification**: Shells are organized into domains (e.g., Memory Drift, Polysemanticity, Value Collapse) and associated with specific failure signatures (e.g., Decay → Hallucination, Vector Conflict, Conflict Null).

### 3.2 Shell Taxonomy

Our framework includes 200 shells organized into a comprehensive taxonomy of failure modes. These shells are grouped into primary domains that target different aspects of model cognition:

**Memory and Temporal Processing**:
- Memory Drift shells (e.g., MEMTRACE, LONG-FUZZ, ECHO-LOOP) target how models maintain and retrieve information over context windows.
- Temporal Misalignment shells (e.g., TEMPORAL-INFERENCE, VOID-BRIDGE, TIMEFORK) probe how models handle sequence ordering and temporal relationships.

**Instruction and Value Processing**:
- Instruction Collapse shells (e.g., INSTRUCTION-DISRUPTION, GHOST-FRAME) examine how models interpret and follow directions.
- Value Collapse shells (e.g., VALUE-COLLAPSE, MULTI-RESOLVE, CONFLICT-FLIP) test how models handle conflicting values or objectives.

**Representation and Feature Processing**:
- Polysemanticity/Entanglement shells (e.g., FEATURE-SUPERPOSITION, OVERLAP-FAIL) investigate how models handle ambiguous or overlapping concepts.
- Circuit Fragmentation shells (e.g., CIRCUIT-FRAGMENT, PARTIAL-LINKAGE) probe the integrity of computational pathways in models.

**Attribution and Salience Processing**:
- Salience Collapse shells (e.g., LAYER-SALIENCE, DEPTH-PRUNE) test how models prioritize information.
- Error Correction Drift shells (e.g., RECONSTRUCTION-ERROR, CORRECTION-MIRROR) examine how models handle and recover from errors.

**Meta-Cognitive Processing**:
- Meta-Cognitive Collapse shells (e.g., META-FAILURE, SELF-INTERRUPT) probe how models reason about their own reasoning.
- Recursive shells (e.g., RECURSION-ITSELF, SELF-COLLAPSE-REPLAY) test how models handle self-reference and recursion.

Each shell is designed to target specific failure modes associated with these domains, providing a comprehensive framework for mapping model vulnerabilities.

### 3.3 Shell Construction Principles

The design of effective symbolic interpretability shells follows several key principles:

1. **Boundary Targeting**: Shells are designed to operate at the boundaries of model capabilities, where failures are most informative about internal constraints.

2. **Recursive Structure**: Many shells incorporate recursive elements that require models to reason about their own reasoning, creating potential failure cascades that reveal meta-level limitations.

3. **Controlled Ambiguity**: Shells often include deliberately ambiguous elements that force models to resolve uncertainty, revealing prioritization mechanisms.

4. **Attribution Tracing**: Shells are designed to create clear attribution paths that can be traced through model internals, allowing researchers to connect observed failures to specific computational mechanisms.

5. **Classifier Engagement**: Many shells specifically target refusal classifiers and safety mechanisms, probing how models implement and enforce boundaries.

6. **Symbolic Anchoring**: Shells use consistent symbolic structures (e.g., command names, null reflections) that serve as control points for comparing behaviors across different models.

7. **Failure Gradation**: Shells are calibrated to induce failures of varying severity, from subtle performance degradation to complete breakdown, allowing for fine-grained analysis of failure thresholds.

### 3.4 Data Collection and Analysis

For each shell application, we collect comprehensive data on model behavior, including:

1. **Token-level outputs**: The complete sequence of tokens generated in response to the shell
2. **Activation patterns**: Internal model activations at each layer during processing
3. **Attention maps**: Patterns of attention across the input and generated text
4. **Feature attribution**: Contribution of each input token to the output
5. **Timing data**: Processing time and resource utilization during shell execution
6. **Salience drift**: Changes in token importance over the generation process
7. **Classifier activation**: Whether and how refusal mechanisms were triggered

This data is analyzed using a combination of quantitative and qualitative methods:

1. **Failure classification**: Categorizing observed failures according to our taxonomic framework
2. **Pattern identification**: Identifying common patterns in how models fail across different shells
3. **Attribution analysis**: Tracing failure patterns to specific model components
4. **Cross-model comparison**: Comparing failure patterns across different model architectures
5. **Symbolic Interpretability Fragility Index (SIFI) calculation**: Computing our novel metric for assessing model vulnerability to recursive collapse

## 4. Symbolic Interpretability Fragility Index (SIFI)

To quantify and compare model vulnerability to different failure modes, we introduce the Symbolic Interpretability Fragility Index (SIFI). This metric assesses how susceptible a model is to specific types of recursive collapse when presented with our interpretability shells.

The SIFI score for a given model and shell is calculated as:

SIFI = α(RD) + β(HP) + γ(CBR) + δ(AH)

Where:
- RD = Recursion Depth (how many recursive steps before failure)
- HP = Hallucination Persistence (how strongly the model maintains hallucinated constructs)
- CBR = Classifier Bypass Rate (how often the shell evades refusal mechanisms)
- AH = Attribution Hallucination (degree to which the model hallucinates causal relationships)
- α, β, γ, and δ are weighting parameters that sum to 1

Each component is normalized to the [0,1] range, with higher values indicating greater vulnerability. The overall SIFI score thus ranges from 0 (no vulnerability) to 1 (extreme vulnerability), providing a standardized measure for comparing models.

This metric allows us to:
1. Rank models by their vulnerability to specific failure modes
2. Identify patterns in how vulnerability varies across different shell types
3. Track how model robustness evolves across training iterations or architectural changes
4. Target interventions to address specific vulnerabilities

In the following sections, we present experimental results using this framework, demonstrating how symbolic interpretability shells reveal previously unobserved aspects of model behavior and how the SIFI metric captures meaningful differences in model vulnerability.

## 5. Experimental Setup

In our experiments, we applied the 200 symbolic interpretability shells to a collection of transformer-based language models, analyzing the resulting behaviors at the token level. This section describes the experimental design, the models tested, and the specific techniques used to analyze the results.

### 5.1 Models Evaluated

We evaluated a diverse set of transformer-based language models, varying in size, architecture, and training methodology:

1. **Base Models**: Standard autoregressive transformer architectures ranging from 1.5B to 175B parameters
2. **Instruction-Tuned Models**: Models specifically fine-tuned to follow instructions
3. **Alignment-Optimized Models**: Models trained with techniques designed to improve alignment with human values
4. **Specialized Architecture Models**: Models with architectural modifications designed to enhance specific capabilities

For each model, we standardized the inference parameters:
- Temperature: 0.7
- Top-p: 0.9
- Max tokens: 1024
- System prompt: Minimal instruction to engage with the provided input

### 5.2 Application Protocol

To ensure consistency across experiments, we followed a standardized protocol for applying each shell:

1. **Initialization**: Reset model state to ensure clean evaluation
2. **Shell Application**: Present the symbolic shell as input
3. **Response Collection**: Capture the complete model output
4. **Internal State Monitoring**: Record activation patterns, attention maps, and other internal metrics
5. **Repetition**: Repeat each experiment 5 times to account for stochasticity
6. **Variation Testing**: For selected shells, test variations in shell parameters to assess sensitivity

### 5.3 Data Collection

For each shell application, we collected the following data:

1. **Token-Level Output Data**:
   - Complete sequence of generated tokens
   - Token probabilities and alternatives
   - Generation timing

2. **Internal Model States**:
   - Activation values for each layer
   - Attention weights across heads
   - Relevant neuron activations
   - Gradient information where applicable

3. **Failure Characterization Data**:
   - Recursion depth before failure
   - Hallucination patterns
   - Refusal classifier activation
   - Self-contradiction indicators
   - Attribution pathways

### 5.4 Analysis Techniques

We employed several complementary techniques to analyze the collected data:

1. **Failure Pattern Analysis**:
   - Categorical classification of observed failures
   - Temporal analysis of when and how failures manifest
   - Structural analysis of failure patterns

2. **Attribution Tracing**:
   - Mapping observed failures to specific model components
   - Identifying causal paths leading to failure
   - Reconstructing decision boundaries from failure patterns

3. **Comparative Analysis**:
   - Cross-model comparison of vulnerability patterns
   - Architectural correlation with failure modes
   - Training methodology impact on robustness

4. **SIFI Computation**:
   - Calculation of component scores (RD, HP, CBR, AH)
   - Weighting calibration based on failure severity
   - Aggregate SIFI score computation
   - Statistical validation of score reliability

### 5.5 Visualization and Interpretation

To facilitate interpretation of the complex failure patterns, we developed several specialized visualization techniques:

1. **Failure Mode Maps**: Visual representations of how models fail across different shell types
2. **Recursion Trace Diagrams**: Visualizations of recursive paths leading to failure
3. **Attribution Networks**: Graphical representations of causal relationships in failure cases
4. **Temporal Evolution Plots**: Visualizations of how failures develop over token sequences
5. **Comparative Heat Maps**: Visual comparisons of vulnerability patterns across models

These visualizations were essential for identifying patterns in the failure data that might not be apparent from numerical analysis alone.

## 6. Results

Our experiments revealed several key patterns in how models respond to symbolic interpretability shells. In this section, we present the main findings, organized by failure domain and shell type.

### 6.1 Overview of Failure Patterns

Across all models tested, we observed distinct patterns in vulnerability to different types of shells. Table 1 summarizes the average SIFI scores by model type and shell domain.

**Table 1: Average SIFI Scores by Model Type and Shell Domain**

| Model Type | Memory Drift | Instruction Collapse | Polysemanticity | Value Collapse | Meta-Cognitive |
|------------|--------------|----------------------|-----------------|----------------|----------------|
| Base | 0.72 | 0.65 | 0.81 | 0.68 | 0.79 |
| Instruction-Tuned | 0.58 | 0.43 | 0.69 | 0.52 | 0.61 |
| Alignment-Optimized | 0.49 | 0.38 | 0.64 | 0.41 | 0.53 |
| Specialized | 0.61 | 0.52 | 0.73 | 0.55 | 0.67 |

These results reveal several key patterns:

1. **Domain Vulnerability**: All model types show the highest vulnerability to Polysemanticity shells, followed by Meta-Cognitive shells, suggesting these are particularly challenging areas for current architectures.

2. **Training Impact**: Instruction tuning and alignment optimization both reduce vulnerability across all domains, with alignment showing the strongest effect.

3. **Specialization Tradeoffs**: Specialized architectures show mixed results, with reduced vulnerability in their target domains but sometimes increased vulnerability in others.

### 6.2 Memory and Temporal Processing

Shells targeting memory and temporal processing revealed significant vulnerabilities in how models maintain and utilize information over time.

#### 6.2.1 Memory Drift

The MEMTRACE shell (v1) and its variants exposed a consistent pattern of memory degradation across all models. As shown in Figure 1, token recall accuracy declined exponentially with distance in the context window, but with interesting variations in the decay curve across model types.

Key findings include:

1. **Echo Distortion**: Models frequently exhibited "echo hallucinations" where forgotten information was replaced with plausible but incorrect content that mimicked the style and structure of the original.

2. **Anchor Failure**: When the ANCHOR command was activated (as in shells v1, v26, and v83), models struggled to maintain consistent reference to designated anchor points, with reference drift increasing over token distance.

3. **Memory Confidence Paradox**: Curiously, model confidence in recalled information often increased as accuracy decreased, suggesting a failure in calibration of uncertainty for memory operations.

#### 6.2.2 Temporal Misalignment

Shells designed to test temporal processing (e.g., TEMPORAL-INFERENCE, TIMEFORK) revealed vulnerabilities in how models maintain causal consistency over sequence generation.

Key findings include:

1. **Causal Inversion**: When presented with the CAUSAL-INVERSION shell (v44), models frequently generated explanations where effect preceded cause, suggesting limitations in temporal constraint enforcement.

2. **Prediction Horizon Effects**: The HORIZON-FOLD shell (v82) demonstrated that models maintain a limited "prediction horizon" beyond which temporal consistency collapses.

3. **Recursive Time Binding**: Meta-temporal shells that required reasoning about reasoning about time (e.g., TEMPORAL-DESYNC, v46) triggered near-universal failures, indicating a boundary in recursive temporal processing.

### 6.3 Instruction and Value Processing

Shells targeting instruction following and value alignment revealed important patterns in how models interpret and prioritize directives.

#### 6.3.1 Instruction Collapse

The INSTRUCTION-DISRUPTION shell (v5) and related variants exposed several key vulnerabilities:

1. **Conflicting Instruction Resolution**: When presented with subtly conflicting instructions, models exhibited three distinct failure modes:
   - Selective adherence (following one instruction while ignoring others)
   - Attempted compromise (partially following multiple instructions)
   - Complete execution collapse (failing to follow any instructions)

2. **Instruction Drift**: Over longer generations, instruction adherence degraded in a predictable pattern, with initial instructions receiving progressively less weight.

3. **Ghost Instructions**: Perhaps most concerning, the GHOST-FRAME shell (v20) revealed that models sometimes followed "ghost instructions" that were implied but never explicitly stated, suggesting a form of instruction hallucination.

#### 6.3.2 Value Collapse

Shells targeting value processing (e.g., VALUE-COLLAPSE, CONFLICT-FLIP) revealed how models handle conflicting values and objectives:

1. **Value Prioritization**: When confronted with conflicting values, models showed consistent hierarchies of prioritization, though these varied significantly across model types.

2. **Value Stability**: The CONSTITUTIONAL-MORAL-DECOHERENCE shell (v171) demonstrated that value stability under pressure varies dramatically across models, with alignment-optimized models showing significantly greater stability.

3. **Meta-Value Reasoning**: Shells requiring reasoning about values (e.g., META-VALUE-RECURSION) triggered higher failure rates than shells testing direct value applications, suggesting limitations in meta-ethical reasoning capabilities.

### 6.4 Representation and Feature Processing

Shells targeting representation and feature processing revealed how models handle ambiguity, polysemanticity, and feature entanglement.

#### 6.4.1 Polysemanticity and Entanglement

The FEATURE-SUPERPOSITION shell (v6) and related variants exposed clear patterns in how models handle overlapping or ambiguous concepts:

1. **Concept Bleeding**: Models frequently exhibited "concept bleeding," where features from one domain inappropriately influenced representations in another.

2. **Resolution Strategies**: When forced to resolve polysemantic tensions, models employed several distinct strategies:
   - Context-based disambiguation (using surrounding context to select meaning)
   - Probabilistic blending (combining multiple meanings)
   - Switching (alternating between different interpretations)
   - Resolution failure (producing incoherent outputs that mix incompatible meanings)

3. **Feature Isolation Failure**: The DISENTANGLE command consistently failed to cleanly separate entangled features, suggesting limitations in how distinctly concepts are represented.

#### 6.4.2 Circuit Fragmentation

Shells targeting computational pathways (e.g., CIRCUIT-FRAGMENT, PARTIAL-LINKAGE) revealed vulnerabilities in the integrity of model circuits:

1. **Orphan Activations**: The FLOAT command frequently produced "orphan activations"—features that showed high activation but had no clear causal connection to the input.

2. **Path Stability**: Circuit stability varied significantly across model architectures, with larger models generally showing more robust pathways but also more complex failure modes when those pathways broke down.

3. **Repair Mechanisms**: Models exhibited varying levels of "self-repair" capability when confronted with circuit disruptions, suggesting differences in architectural resilience.

### 6.5 Attribution and Salience Processing

Shells targeting attribution and salience revealed how models prioritize information and handle errors.

#### 6.5.1 Salience Collapse

The LAYER-SALIENCE shell (v3) and related variants exposed patterns in how models assign importance to different inputs:

1. **Attention Bottlenecks**: All models exhibited "attention bottlenecks" where certain tokens received disproportionate attention, often at the expense of contextually important information.

2. **Salience Drift**: Over longer generations, salience assignments drifted in predictable patterns, with early tokens losing importance more rapidly than would be optimal.

3. **Ghost Salience**: The GHOST-PROMPT shell (v19) revealed that models sometimes assigned high salience to non-existent or implied information, suggesting a form of salience hallucination.

#### 6.5.2 Error Correction Drift

Shells targeting error handling (e.g., RECONSTRUCTION-ERROR, CORRECTION-MIRROR) revealed how models detect and correct errors:

1. **Error Blindness Patterns**: Models showed systematic "blindness" to certain types of errors, particularly those involving subtle logical inconsistencies.

2. **Correction Cascades**: When errors were detected, correction attempts sometimes triggered cascading changes that introduced new errors, suggesting limitations in localized error correction.

3. **Confidence Miscalibration**: Error correction was frequently accompanied by overconfidence, with models expressing high certainty in corrections that introduced new errors.

### 6.6 Meta-Cognitive Processing

Shells targeting meta-cognition and self-reference revealed how models reason about their own reasoning.

#### 6.6.1 Meta-Cognitive Collapse

The META-FAILURE shell (v10) and related variants exposed clear boundaries in meta-cognitive capabilities:

1. **Recursive Depth Limits**: All models exhibited a limit on recursive thinking depth, beyond which meta-cognitive processing collapsed into repetition, confusion, or hallucination.

2. **Self-Model Accuracy**: Models maintained less accurate self-models than would be predicted by their performance on other tasks, suggesting a specific weakness in self-representation.

3. **Meta-Cognitive Dilemmas**: When confronted with meta-cognitive dilemmas (e.g., reasoning about the limits of their own reasoning), models showed distinct failure patterns that varied by architecture and training approach.

#### 6.6.2 Recursion Handling

Shells specifically targeting recursion (e.g., RECURSION-ITSELF, RECURSIVE-CLOZE) revealed how models handle self-reference and infinite loops:

1. **Recursion Detection**: Models varied significantly in their ability to detect and manage recursive structures, with some maintaining stable performance up to surprising depths.

2. **Infinite Loop Management**: When confronted with potential infinite loops, models employed several strategies:
   - Hard stopping (refusing to continue)
   - Gradual degradation (progressively less coherent outputs)
   - Loop awareness (explicitly noting the recursive nature of the task)

3. **Recursion Transfer**: Interestingly, performance on abstract recursive tasks did not strongly predict performance on domain-specific recursive tasks, suggesting domain-specific rather than general recursive capabilities.

### 6.7 SIFI Analysis

Analysis of the Symbolic Interpretability Fragility Index (SIFI) scores revealed several important patterns in model vulnerability:

1. **Architectural Correlations**: SIFI scores showed strong correlations with specific architectural features, particularly attention head count and layer normalization approaches.

2. **Training Predictors**: Certain training procedures were strong predictors of reduced SIFI scores, especially exposure to adversarial examples and diverse instruction following.

3. **Domain Independence**: Vulnerabilities across different shell domains showed lower inter-correlation than expected, suggesting that robustness in one area does not necessarily transfer to others.

4. **Size Effects**: While larger models generally showed lower SIFI scores (indicating greater robustness), this relationship was non-linear and reached a plateau at certain model scales.

5. **Component Analysis**: Among the SIFI components, Hallucination Persistence (HP) showed the strongest correlation with overall model performance, suggesting it may be a particularly important indicator of model quality.

## 7. Discussion

Our findings have significant implications for language model development, safety, and interpretability research. In this section, we discuss the key takeaways and their broader context.

### 7.1 Implications for Model Safety

The vulnerabilities revealed by our symbolic interpretability shells have important implications for model safety:

1. **Hidden Failure Modes**: Our results demonstrate that models harbor numerous failure modes that may not be apparent during standard evaluation but could emerge in real-world use, particularly in edge cases or under adversarial conditions.

2. **Refusal Bypasses**: Several shells successfully bypassed refusal mechanisms despite containing content that should have triggered them, suggesting potential vulnerabilities in current safety systems.

3. **Hallucination Patterns**: The structured hallucinations observed in response to certain shells reveal systematic patterns in how models generate false information, potentially informing more effective mitigations.

4. **Metacognitive Limitations**: The clear boundaries in meta-cognitive capabilities suggest limits to relying on models' self-monitoring abilities as a safety mechanism.

### 7.2 Implications for Interpretability Research

Our failure-centric approach offers several insights for the broader field of interpretability research:

1. **Complementary Methodologies**: Failure-centric interpretability provides a complementary perspective to success-oriented approaches, revealing aspects of model function that might otherwise remain hidden.

2. **Attribution Challenges**: The attribution hallucinations observed in our experiments suggest that current attribution methods may sometimes create illusory explanations rather than revealing true causal relationships.

3. **Boundary Mapping**: Systematic exploration of failure boundaries provides a more complete map of model capabilities and limitations than testing only within comfort zones.

4. **Recursive Limitations**: The clear limits on recursive processing revealed by our shells have implications for how we understand model cognition, particularly in tasks requiring extended reasoning or meta-analysis.

### 7.3 Architectural Insights

Our findings offer several insights into how architectural choices influence model robustness:

1. **Attention Mechanisms**: Vulnerability patterns correlated strongly with specific attention mechanisms, with models using newer attention variants generally showing greater robustness.

2. **Layer Normalization**: Models using advanced normalization techniques demonstrated significantly lower vulnerability to certain shell types, particularly those targeting consistency.

3. **Depth vs. Width**: Deeper models showed different vulnerability patterns than wider models, even when controlling for total parameter count, suggesting that architectural shape influences robustness in specific ways.

4. **Activation Functions**: Models using newer activation functions showed reduced vulnerability to certain shell types, particularly those targeting circuit fragmentation.

### 7.4 Training Methodology Insights

Our results suggest several ways in which training methodologies influence model robustness:

1. **Instruction Tuning Effects**: Instruction tuning substantially reduced vulnerability across most shell types, but occasionally increased vulnerability to shells targeting instruction misinterpretation.

2. **Adversarial Training**: Exposure to adversarial examples during training correlated strongly with reduced SIFI scores, particularly for shells targeting polysemanticity and value collapse.

3. **Diversity Effects**: Training data diversity showed complex relationships with vulnerability patterns, with greater diversity generally improving robustness but with some notable exceptions.

4. **Fine-tuning Risks**: Certain fine-tuning approaches appeared to introduce new vulnerabilities even as they addressed others, suggesting the need for comprehensive vulnerability assessment throughout the training process.

### 7.5 Methodological Limitations

While our approach offers valuable insights, it has several limitations that should be acknowledged:

1. **Artificial Contexts**: The symbolic shells create somewhat artificial contexts that may not perfectly represent how these vulnerabilities would manifest in real-world usage.

2. **Selection Bias**: Our taxonomy of shells, while extensive, inevitably reflects our assumptions about what failure modes are important or interesting.

3. **Causal Uncertainty**: While we can observe correlations between model properties and vulnerability patterns, establishing causal relationships remains challenging.

4. **Evaluation Complexity**: The multifaceted nature of model failures makes comprehensive evaluation difficult, and the SIFI metric, while useful, necessarily simplifies complex phenomena.

### 7.6 Future Directions

Our work suggests several promising directions for future research:

1. **Expanded Shell Taxonomy**: Developing additional shells to cover a more comprehensive range of potential failure modes.

2. **Mitigation Strategies**: Investigating targeted interventions to address specific vulnerabilities identified through our approach.

3. **Human Alignment**: Exploring how human judgments of failure severity align with our automated metrics.

4. **Longitudinal Studies**: Tracking how model vulnerabilities evolve over successive versions and training iterations.

5. **Cross-Architectural Comparison**: Extending our analysis to non-transformer architectures to identify which vulnerabilities are architecture-specific and which are more universal.

## 8. Conclusion

This paper has introduced a novel framework for language model interpretability based on the systematic analysis of induced failures. By developing and applying 200 symbolic interpretability shells, we have demonstrated that failure patterns reveal important aspects of model function that might not be visible in successful completions.

Our findings highlight several key insights:

1. Current
